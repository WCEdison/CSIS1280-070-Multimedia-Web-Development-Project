        <p> One of the primary benefits of hiking as a hobby is the opportunity for physical activity and exercise.
            After
            spending long hours in classrooms and sitting at desks, postgraduates may find that hiking provides a
            much-needed break and a chance to get outside and move their bodies. Hiking can also be a low-impact
            form of
            exercise that is suitable for individuals of all fitness levels, making it an accessible hobby for those
            who
            may
            not be comfortable with high-intensity workouts.</p>

        <p>
            In addition to the physical benefits, hiking can also provide opportunities for stress relief and
            relaxation.
            The act of being in nature and away from the stresses of daily life can be incredibly rejuvenating and
            restorative. Hiking can also provide an opportunity to disconnect from technology and social media,
            allowing
            individuals to fully immerse themselves in the present moment and appreciate the natural world around
            them.
