            more deeply, evaluate evidence and analyze arguments effectively.</p>
        <p> Thirdly, reading can help post-graduates develop their communication skills, both written and verbal.

            long
            day of studying or working. Reading fiction has been shown to reduce stress levels and improve overall
            well-being.</p>
